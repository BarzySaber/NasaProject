This API is not for public
you need to have API_KEY for getting data from it
I have created my Api_key then I used it for authentication in my code 
I used in a query parameter
I create a class for checking my status code
I created a class based on POJO for serialization and deserialization
I converted the response to JSON so I can get the data as it objects instead of as a String so I can work on it and use them
I have a utility package and created a ConfigurationReader class that is gonna read and load the Configuration. properties file into my project and I can use it
I have Configuration.properties I stored some data its use key-value pair and I put the important data there so I can get them easily and maintain them easily.
